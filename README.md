# Based on SimpleC-one Conky

This is my modification of [this](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1265258/) theme for conky.
I removed some things to me unnecessary, like the weather widget and its python script, start and stop scripts and consolidated all the separated conkyrcs to just one, making this just fine with a simple conky command.
Next thing I will do is change this to the Lua synthax, this way I will be sure it works in future versions of the program.
